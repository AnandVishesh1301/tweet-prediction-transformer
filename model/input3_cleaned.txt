the greatest election fraud in our history is about to happen this may top the democrats illegally spying on my campaign
continued

all the radical left democrats are trying to do with the post office hearings is blame the republicans for the fraud that will occur because of the 51 million ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested them they are setting the table for a big mess

god bless the usa















thank you to cardinaldolan for this evenings opening prayer
















thank you #rnc2020

for our country to be sending 80 million unsolicited ballots is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster fraudulent amp missing ballots like never seen before 20 and 30 off stop
i am pleased to inform the american public that acting secretary chad wolf will be nominated to be the secretary of homeland security chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service
they must stop calling these anarchists and agitators peaceful protestors come back into the real world the federal government is ready to end this problem immediately upon your request
80 million unsolicited ballots are impossible for election centers to tabulate accurately the democrats know this better than anyone else the fraud and abuse will be an embarrassment to our country hopefully the courts will stop this scam





































































democrats hate that i called for big pharma to match the lowest prescription drug prices in the world by using a favored nations clause prices will plunge

why hasnt obama created jobs
why has obama let china and others take our jobs
good response on jobs by mittromney
then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices
so far mittromney is winning big
mittromney looks much stronger and much more presidential
obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasnt he done it its all talk
obama just said mittromney was a very successful investor big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility
obama is looking rhetorical and weak mittromney is looking strong and sharp
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton
mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems obama has no answer
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama no wonder nothing gets done
debate showed these guys really hate each other at one point it looked like they would come to blows
george will said best debate he ever saw if you ever heard george will speakboring anything is exciting
stupid george will gave mittromney no chance 3 months ago take off his little spectacles and hes just another dummy
do you believe barack hussein obama aka barry soetoro looked like a president last night i dont
obama did much better than he did last timebut still lost decisively
polls are starting to look really bad for obama looks like hell have to start a war or major conflict to win dont put it past him

congratulations to tom scocca and timothy burke of deadspin for exposing the manti teoo fiasco
or mentally troubled or a con
not believable that manti teoo was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died he is either very stupid
can it just be new age that manti teoo fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax
imo manti teoo was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the heisman trophy
espnos apologybrent musburger was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct
brent musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before
dumbass billmaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice
billmaheros show is great for helping me get to sleep better than sominex
hbo should fire billmaher and bring back dennisdmz someone that is actually funny
ill bet lance armstrong wishes he didnt do the interview with oprah hes saying to himself what was i thinking
the interview with oprah will cause lance armstrong huge legal and financial problems sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide
boeing stock went way down because of 787 so i just bought stock in boeing great company

oprah was great amazing that she got lance armstrong to totally destroy his life why did he ever do that interview
the interview was great for oprah and terrible for lance armstrong
teooos imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all timeior heos very stupid
i still say teo did this in order to get sympathy for the heisman voteithankfully he did not win
alabama people are saying their team has real football real girlfriendsinot good for notre dameibut theyoll be back

whether you are a republican or democrat we should hope that pres barackobama does a great job for the country

the presidentos speech was very combative toward republicansithey have obviously not earned his respect
if the republicans need a chief negotiator i am always availableor can recommend some really good ones
part of obamaos newfound confidence is that the republicans arenot using their power of ideas properly or effectively

the worst negotiators in history otherwise known as republicans have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months pathetic
republicans are always worried about their general approval with proposing to ignore the debt ceiling they are ignoring their base
watch this great behind the scenes video of ivankatrumps spring 2013 photo shoot
one positive from last week for lance was that everyone was focused on manti teo why did lance do that interview
the tea party delivered the house for gop so they could be fiscally responsible instead they have been irresponsible
has pres obama or the white house told the public what happened in algeria yet whereos the media
happy 8th anniversary to melaniatrumppictwittercomy45ssfyx

why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington he doesnt want to detract from his press glory
i give the presidents speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 not bad but room for improvement

joe1spro realdonaldtrump the president of syria is killing people inhumanly but the so called rebels may be just as bad or worse
cadams2513 realdonaldtrump if trump was potus we would have all the money we need # trump 2016 thats true
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syriabig mistake if he does not
syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locationsamazing
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes call it the plenty of notice war
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune laugh at us

todays wsj editorial is wrong again i know that china is not in the new tpp trade deal but would come in latter through a back door
wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and tpp and apologize china not part but will get their way in later
when and how are the dummies at the wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me i want smart trade deals
why wouldnt the wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong no wonder it is doing poorly
karlrove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp this moron wasted 430 million on political campaigns and lost 100
why does the failing wsj write a false editorial about me and let dummy karlrove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper
wsj and dopey karl rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible tpp deal
from 2 to 27 in texas quite a jump into first place

jeb failed as jeb he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother who got us into the quicksand of iraq spent 120 millionweakno chance
we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me we are watching
truthinvest cnn tedcruz realdonaldtrump ted cruz is the definition of sleaze just ask realbencarson
cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w realbencarson how can he preach christian values
weak jeb getting thrown out by management during speech do you think he will be this tough on putin others
how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest

foxbusiness reptommarino i think realdonaldtrump can beat hillaryclinton and im looking forward to trump being president
reptommarino great job on television this morning glad to have you on my side
is this what we want for a president
yesterday was amazingi5 victories lyino ted cruz had zero things are going very well
i will be interviewed on the oreilly factor this evening at 8 pm on the fox news channel oreillyfactor
crazy megynkelly supposedly had lyin ted cruz on her show last night ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse ted cant win
great news that foxnews has cancelled the additional debate how many times can the same people ask the same question i beat cruz debating
crazy megynkelly is now complaining that oreillyfactor did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on metough
the reason lyin ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just dont tolerate liarsa big problem
see you in arizona on friday and saturday
looking like my 5 victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio two more days and ohio was mine
highly overrated crazy megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me focus on others megyn
who should star in a reboot of liar liar hillary clinton or ted cruz let me know
make america great again
hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life
lyin ted cruz lost all five races on tuesdayand he was just given the jinx a lindsey graham endorsement also backed jeb lindsey got 0
senator lindseygrahamsc made horrible statements about sentedcruz i and then he endorsed him no wonder nobody trusts politicians
ewerickson got fired like a dog from redstate and now he is the one leading opposition against me
mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesnt have a clue no wonder he lost

lyin ted cruz cant get votes i am millions ahead of him so he has to get his delegates from the republican bosses it wont work
crooked hillary clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me i am the one person she doesnt want to run against will be such fun
i would have millions of votes more than hillary except for the fact that i had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named bernie
lyin ted cruz cant win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bossesi am millions of votes ahead hillary would destroy him k
kasich only looks ok in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him
lyino ted cruz even voted against superstorm sandy aid and september 11th help so many new yorkers devastated cruz hates new york

it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton what she did was wrong what bill did was stupid
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the usag was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the usag to work out a deal the system is totally rigged corrupt
the system is rigged
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the usag talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the usag so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught
crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis it will just go on forever we need change
happy 4th of july # trump2016 # americafirst pictwittercomyhhyqjwjw6

crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs

the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive well
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes no way they are going to fix americas problems isis all others laughing
hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened

the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar
dems dont want to talk isis bc hillarys foreign interventions unleashed isis her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here
many of bernies supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep
funny how the failing nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius america 1st
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition sad
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no
not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one pathetic

why doesnt the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republicans won ratings
word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta

my rallies are not covered properly by the media they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media she is not a talented person or politician the dishonest media refuses to expose
it is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false
i have always been the same personremain true to selfthe media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so
certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the ussupreme court get proper appointments sad
